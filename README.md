# Alta_Scuola_Politecnica
This repository encompasses projects developed during the two-year Alta Scuola Politecnica (ASP) honours programme, a joint initiative by Politecnico di Milano and Politecnico di Torino. The ASP programme is designed for exceptionally talented students enrolled in Master's degree courses in Architecture, Design, and Engineering. It offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that combines advanced coursework with real-world projects, aiming to foster innovation and cross-disciplinary collaboration. One of the key projects featured is the VinPRO project, which focuses on automating vine pruning in vineyards. This project integrates robotics and control systems to enhance agricultural efficiency, addressing challenges in precision agriculture. The team developed a prototype capable of identifying and pruning vines autonomously, contributing to advancements in sustainable farming practices. The Innovation courses complemented the project work by providing a theoretical foundation in areas such as innovation management, design thinking, and sustainability.
