# Alta_Scuola_Politecnica
This repository encompasses projects developed during the two-year Alta Scuola Politecnica (ASP) honours programme, a joint initiative by Politecnico di Milano and Politecnico di Torino. The ASP programme is designed for exceptionally talented students enrolled in Master's degree courses in Architecture, Design, and Engineering. The program brings together students from diverse backgrounds to tackle real challenges. One standout: the VinPRO project â€“ a remarkable effort where a team built a robot that autonomously prunes vines, pushing the boundaries of sustainable agriculture. Innovation courses grounded the work in creative thinking, management, and impact.
